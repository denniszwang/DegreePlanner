1. **CIS Electives Suggestion**:
    - **Graphs:** Build a graph where nodes represent courses and edges represent relationships between courses, such as prerequisites or similarities based on user interest.
    - **Graph Traversal:** Traverse the graph based on user interests to find the best matching courses. Algorithms like depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) can be utilized for this purpose.

2. **Non-CIS Course Searching**:
    - **Trie:** Implement a trie data structure to efficiently store and search for course information based on department IDs, course IDs, or course names.
    - **Autocomplete:** Utilize trie traversal to provide autocomplete suggestions as the user types, enhancing the search experience.
    - **Auto-correct:** Incorporate algorithms like Levenshtein distance to suggest corrections for typos in course searches.

3. **Course Planning and Scheduling**:
    - **Hashing:** Use hashing to implement a schedule where each slot corresponds to a time slot in the user's intended course schedule.
    - **Insertion and Deletion:** Hash tables can efficiently handle insertion and deletion operations, allowing users to add or remove courses from their schedule with ease.

4. **AI-Based Mentor Matching**:
    - **Matching Algorithm:** Utilize algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN) or collaborative filtering to match users with mentors based on their interests and the mentor's background.
    - **Data Representation:** Represent user interests and mentor backgrounds using appropriate data structures (e.g., vectors, sets) for efficient comparison and matching.
